# SortingAlgorithmsVisualised

## What is it?
This will run a sorting  algorithm of choice, and update the UI thread edach sort. This lets us see what the algorithm does. 
I made this because I injured both of my hands and couldn't work, so I spent too long one handed typing. Also for fun.

## How to use
Open a terminal and type: 
```
$ npm run dev
```
This will open a light-server at localhost:9000.

After that, press one of the buttons and enjoy the show.

If you wish to make changes, edit the TypeScript files under /src, and then type:
```
$ npm run build
```
And then refresh the page.
